<h1> About My Self :</h1>
<p>  As a Computer Science Student at ITER , SOA University, My desire is to apply the knowledge I gain to the world of technology and solve complicated problems . My sphere of Interest includes DevOps and Public Policy. ⬇️ As the Regulatory Compliance's around Technology Companies intensifies across the globe they resort to Public Policy Analyst : Someone who has the technical expertise, understands the law, and can undertake research, or someone who can communicate effectively with stakeholders ( ie. Governments and Regulatory Bodies). Technological developments precede regulations and public-policy have to catch up. My proficiency in Various Technologies and cognizance of Public Policy hopefully would be constructive in any manner. In Autumn of 2022, I'm doing my Basic Certifications of Java . I am currently focusing on Cloud Native Services in my current study semester and looking for summer 2023 tech internships. Feel free to check out my Portfolio and add me on Socials.</p>
